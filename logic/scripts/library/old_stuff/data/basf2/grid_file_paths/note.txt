Number of events:
    generic_charge : 2964628566 
    generic_mix : 1813905232
    
-> generic_mix / generic_charge = ~ 0.612

At about 50% reconstruction progress:
    generic_charge -> 38629 reconstructed sideband events
    generic_mix -> 23409 reconstructed sideband events

After scaling number of reconstructed charged events by
the above ratio:
    generic_charge -> 23641 reconstructed sideband events
