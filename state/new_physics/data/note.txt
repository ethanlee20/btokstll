This dataset is B -> K* mu+ mu- monte carlo generated using Alexei's new physics generator.

It includes data generated at various values of delta C9.

It (currently) only contains B -> K* mu+ mu- data.

The files contain both generator level and detector level data and have been pre-processed
to include decay variables such as q^2, cos theta mu, cos theta K, and chi.

Each raw file is a pickled pandas dataframe.
